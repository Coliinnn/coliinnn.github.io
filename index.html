  <p>My research interests lie specifically with the domain of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. With my research, I aim to improve our understanding of how CBT for youth with (persistent) anxiety or OCD can be improved and to identify the mechanisms of change.

  <p>In my spare time I enjoy running, playing the piano, and tinkering with computers and software. <a href="{% post_url 2022-08-24-a-new-website %}">This very website</a> is a result of the latter hobby, and I <a href="{% post_url 2022-03-15-transforming-a-university-pc-to-my-new-homelab %}">transformed an old University pc to a home-server</a> to allow me to experiment with programming, systems administration, and networking. Sometimes I blog about the things that I learn as I go, which can be found <a href="/blog">below</a>.</p>
