### Ongoing Projects
&emsp;&ensp;**September, 2022 - July, 2023: Master's Thesis**.  Currently, I am working on my Master's Thesis, which focuses on intensive and personalised exposure and response prevention (ERP) for children and young persons with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The research consists of a single-case experimental design ([SCED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-subject_design){:target="_blank"}), with which we hope to discover whether such an intensive treatment results in improved symptomatology for these children.

**September, 2022 - July, 2023: Systematic Reviews**. Additionally, I am also working on a systematic review regarding treatments for children and young persons for whom previous treatments were unsuccessful, and another systematic review regarding existing intensive treatments that have been used with children and young persons with OCD.

**October, 2022 - November, 2022: Research Assistant**. I will be working as research assistant to help one of my professors with a study for which the experiments have just concluded. Participants were filmed as part of the experiment, and I will be responsible for the rating of these videos according to a standardised observational rating scheme.


### Previous Projects
**January, 2022 - September, 2022: Research Assistant**. I worked as research assistant with one of my professors. Because the experiment itself had already been carried out, during which it was assessed whether feelings of awe would lead to increased feelings of meaning in life, I was responsible for writing up the paper and getting it ready to submit to a journal. This also involved initially looking for and collecting relevant literature, reviewing the literature, forming arguments, and finally coming to a conclusion regarding the current state of the literature and the innovations that this study bring. I spent a lot of time theorising about awe, meaning in life, and religion.
