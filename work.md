### Ongoing Projects
**November, 2022 - November, 2023: Intensive anxiety/OCD Treatments**. As part of the Accare Child Study Center, I set up and conducted a systematic review and meta analysis regarding intensive treatment options for children and adolescents with anxiety or OCD. This involved organising the project and setting up collaborations between national and international colleagues, screening the results and extracting data from the included studies, analysing the results and writing the paper.

**September, 2022 - September, 2023: Treatments for Anxiety/OCD Non-Responders**. Additionally, I worked on a systematic review regarding treatment options for children and adolescents with anxiety or OCD, for who previous treatments were unsuccessful (partial and non-response to treatment). My work involved screening the results for relevant studies, extracting data from included papers, discussing issues and and contributing to the writing of the report.

&emsp;&ensp;**September, 2022 - July, 2023: Master's Thesis**. During my master's thesis, I investigated the effectiveness and acceptance of an intensive and presonalised treatment programme for youth with OCD. The research consisted of single-case experimental designs ([SCEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-subject_design){:target="_blank"}). This project is currently ongoing, so the results are not yet known.

**October, 2022 - May, 2023: Women and Men**. I worked as research assistant assist in a project where an experimental design was used to investigate women's behaviours in response to obtrusive behaviours of men. As part of the experiment, participants were filmed. My work involved assessing the (150+) video recordings of the experiment and rating the participants' behaviours on a standardised observational rating scale. Afterwards, the second rater and myself compared and discussed each rating in order to reach consensus.

### Previous Projects
**January, 2022 - September, 2022: Awe and Meaning in Life**. I worked as research assistant with Dr. Ostafin. Using an experimental design, it was assessed whether feelings of awe would lead to increased feelings of meaning in life. I was responsible for collecting relevant literature, reviewing the literature, and forming arguments. This involved a lot of time theorising about awe, meaning in life, and religion. Finally, my work consisted of writing and preparing the manuscript to submit it to a scientific journal.
