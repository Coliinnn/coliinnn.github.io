title: "Importing iTunes play history intoÂ Last.fm"

Recently, I discovered [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/).

Last.fm is a website that provides track, album and artist recommendations based on listening history. Of most interest to me is that Last.FM also provides detailed statistics of users' listening history, such as play counts and which artists and albums I have listened to the most.

Although iTunes also keeps track of play counts, it is limited to individual track counts and iTunes provides no way of visualising the data. And so, I went looking for a solution to import my listening history (of six years!) from iTunes into Last.FM.
